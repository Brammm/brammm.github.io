I'm Bram Van der Sype. I'm a freelance PHP Developer, currently working for [Sparkcentral](http://www.sparkcentral.com). I try to keep track of some things here. If you'd like to discuss anything, you can reach me on Twitter, [@Brammm](https://twitter.com/Brammm), or on Github, you can find the repo for this site [there as well](https://github.com/Brammm/brammm.github.io).
